# Charlie Sproul EGM722 Assignment

--- 

### Introduction
The script within this repository aims to use data made available by the Environment Agency to first convert the 
location of sewer outfall locations in England from OS Grid References to latitude and longitude co-ordinates. Secondly,
these locations are manipulated and plotted on an interactive map, which categorises sewer locations based on the amount 
of time that they discharged raw untreated sewage into the river network.  

Ordnance Survey Grid Reference to lat/lon script uses data made available by the Environment Agency, however this 
does require pre-filtering in Microsoft Access Database and exporting as a csv file prior to use within the script.

#### Script One: OS Grid Ref to Lat Lon

This script converts OS Grid Reference co-ordinates into latitude and longitude co-ordinates, enabling spatial analysis 
and display using GIS
software. The second script manipulates and merges datasets for the location of inland sewer outfall
pipes and data for the activity of these pipes. It displays this data in an interactive map

#### Script Two: Sewage Interactive Map

This script uses opensource data made available by the Environment Agency for the location of sewer outlet pipes with 
current permits to discharge untreated raw sewage into the river network. 
It showcases the location of outlet pipes, categorises them based on how long they have discharged raw sewage in the 
last year for, and displays the users location or a user inputted location.

### Installation/Set up Instructions
The codes within this repository require the use of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and PyCharm is utilised 
by the author for this work. Additionally, a Jupyter Notebook is used for the Sewage Interactive Map and to run the 
environment for these scripts. 


All code, data files and dependencies can be found within the repository 'Charlie-Sproul' EGM722 Assignment, accessible
