The Ordnance Survey Grid Reference to lat/lon script uses data made available by the Environment Agency, however this 
does require pre-filtering in Microsoft Access Database and exporting as a csv file prior to use within the script.

#### Script One: OS Grid Ref to Lat Lon

This script converts OS Grid Reference co-ordinates into latitude and longitude co-ordinates, enabling spatial analysis 
and display using GIS
software. The second script manipulates and merges datasets for the location of inland sewer outfall
pipes and data for the activity of these pipes. It displays this data in an interactive map
